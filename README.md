# Micky Mod

## Overview

Welcome to Micky Mod! I created this mod as part of my journey to learn Java and dive into modding. While this mod may not be the most polished or feature-rich, it's a fun starting point. I personally find more enjoyment in coding something myself rather than just following tutorials.

Feel free to use this mod in your own projects or fork it for further development. It's simple to understand and modify—if you want to add your own features, like capes, you can easily do so by looking at the code.

## Features

- **Cape Mod:** The main feature of the mod is the ability to add capes to players.
- **Customizable:** You can modify the code to add your own features or tweak existing ones. It’s built with flexibility in mind.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the mod files.
2. Take a look at the code to see how the cape system works.
3. Feel free to fork the mod or integrate it into your own project.
4. You can add new features or customize the mod as you like.

## Contributing
